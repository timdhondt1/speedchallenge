My take on the Comma.ai programming challenge. Mostly meant as a nice personal project in between jobs, but might send it as my application to Comma.ai, who knows.

Approach
-----

First plan of attack is to use the Farneback optical flow method as explained <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html"> Here </a>

Install & run:

Coming soon...


Original challenge description from commaai/speedchallenge:

Welcome to the comma.ai Programming Challenge!
======

Your goal is to predict the speed of a car from a video.

- data/train.mp4 is a video of driving containing 20400 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
- data/train.txt contains the speed of the car at each frame, one speed on each line.
- data/test.mp4 is a different driving video containing 10798 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.

Deliverable
-----

Your deliverable is test.txt. E-mail it to givemeajob@comma.ai, or if you think you did particularly well, e-mail it to George.

Evaluation
-----

We will evaluate your test.txt using mean squared error. <10 is good. <5 is better. <3 is heart.
